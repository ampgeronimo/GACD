#Downloading and Loading data

Reads the descriptive activity names to activity_labels
Reads the column names of data to features
Reads the X_test data frame to x_test
Reads the y_test data frame to y_test
Reads the X_train data frame to x_train
Reads the y_train data frame to y_train
Reads the subject_test data frame to subject_test
Reads the subject_train data.frame to subject_train

#Manipulating Data
1. merging subject_test,y_test,x_test, subject_train,y_train,x_train into one data frame df
2. renaming headers using features data frame
3. changing
